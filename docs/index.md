Code and documentation for `v1` version on [this branch][v1-branch].

## Quickstart

### Simple backup using Docker CLI

To run a one time backup, bind your local volume to `/backup` in the container and run the `backup` command:

```shell
 docker run --rm --network your_network_name \
 -v $PWD/backup:/backup/ \
 -e "DB_HOST=dbhost" \
 -e "DB_USERNAME=username" \
 -e "DB_PASSWORD=password" \
 jkaninda/pg-bkup backup -d database_name
```

Alternatively, pass a `--env-file` in order to use a full config as described below.

```yaml
 docker run --rm --network your_network_name \
 --env-file your-env-file \
 -v $PWD/backup:/backup/ \
 jkaninda/pg-bkup backup -d database_name
```

### Simple backup in docker compose file

```yaml
services:
  pg-bkup:
    # In production, it is advised to lock your image tag to a proper
    # release version instead of using `latest`.
    # Check https://github.com/jkaninda/pg-bkup/releases
    # for a list of available releases.
    image: jkaninda/pg-bkup
    container_name: pg-bkup
    command: backup
    volumes:
      - ./backup:/backup
    environment:
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_NAME=foo
      - DB_USERNAME=bar
      - DB_PASSWORD=password
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
    # pg-bkup container must be connected to the same network with your database
    networks:
       - web
networks:
  web:
```
### Docker recurring backup

```shell
 docker run --rm --network network_name \
 -v $PWD/backup:/backup/ \
 -e "DB_HOST=hostname" \
 -e "DB_USERNAME=user" \
 -e "DB_PASSWORD=password" \
 jkaninda/pg-bkup backup -d dbName --cron-expression "@every 15m" #@midnight
```

              cpu: "500m"
          env:
            - name: DB_HOST

              name: backup
      volumes:
        - name: backup
          hostPath:
            path: /home/toto/backup # directory location on host

## Available image registries

This Docker image is published to both Docker Hub and the GitHub container registry.
Depending on your preferences and needs, you can reference both `jkaninda/pg-bkup` as well as `ghcr.io/jkaninda/pg-bkup`:

```
docker pull jkaninda/pg-bkup
docker pull ghcr.io/jkaninda/pg-bkup
```

Documentation references Docker Hub, but all examples will work using ghcr.io just as well.

## References

We decided to publish this image as a simpler and more lightweight alternative because of the following requirements:

- The original image is based on `Alpine` and requires additional tools, making it heavy.
- This image is written in Go.
- `arm64` and `arm/v7` architectures are supported.
- Docker in Swarm mode is supported.
- Kubernetes is supported.
